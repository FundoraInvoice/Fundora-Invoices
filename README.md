# Fundora 🧾💸

*Tokenized Invoice Financing Platform on Base*

Fundora empowers small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to turn unpaid invoices into instant liquidity. By leveraging blockchain technology, we tokenize invoices as NFTs and connect them to DeFi liquidity pools, enabling fast, transparent, and cost-effective financing — all on the Base network.

## 🚨 Problem

- *Delayed Payments*: 60% of SMEs suffer from cash flow issues due to unpaid invoices.
- *Traditional Financing Is Broken*: High fees (2–5%), slow manual approval processes, and limited access.
- *DeFi Lacks Real-World Integration*: Stablecoins and DeFi yield are underutilized for solving tangible SME problems.

---

## 💡 Solution

*Fundora bridges DeFi and real-world finance through invoice tokenization.*

- *Invoice Tokenization*: Invoices are minted as NFTs with embedded metadata (amount, due date, credit rating).
- *USDC Liquidity Pools*: DeFi investors deposit stablecoins into pools to fund SMEs and earn yield.
- *Smart Contract Automation*: Handles funding, repayment, and yield distribution — all on-chain.
- *User Dashboards*:
  - *SMEs*: Upload and track invoices, view liquidity received, repay transparently.
  - *Investors*: View invoice opportunities, invest with full risk data, monitor returns.

## ⚙ How It Works

1. *SME Uploads Invoice* → NFT is minted with metadata.
2. *Smart Contract Verifies Invoice* and lists it for funding.
3. *DeFi Investor Provides USDC* → SME receives instant liquidity.
4. *Invoice Matures* → SME repays with interest.
5. *Investor Receives Yield* via automated smart contract logic.
